# New Introduction Draft

**(Start with a slide that is intentionally provocative. It could show a robot arm typing at a keyboard, with a human developer looking worried in the background. Or simply the question: "Is AI the end of front-end development?")**

"Good morning. Everyone's talking about AI, and it's natural to wonder: Will AI take over front-end development? Will our skills become useless? I understand these concerns, but I want to show you a different way to look at it.

My belief is simple: the current AI era isn't a radical break, but a powerful evolution. It will make our work as front-end developers even more engaging and valuable, because the true value we bring has never been just about writing lines of code. It's always been about creativity, adaptability, and crafting exceptional user experiences.

And let me be clear: AI is not hype. It's crucial for us to adopt. In every era of software development, some technologies and developers get left behind. My hope is that by spending the next 45 minutes on a retrospective of web development from the late 90s to today, we can understand the patterns of change and ensure we're the ones moving forward.

My name is Artem Deikun, and together we're going to trace the 'Ages of JavaScript' to see how our quest for better tools has led us to this moment. By understanding our history, we can confidently embrace the AI era not as an ending, but as the most exciting new chapter in our story.

Finally, this talk is my personal take on our industry's journey, and I encourage you to engage, agree, or even strongly disagree during our Q&A."
