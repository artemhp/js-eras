# New Introduction Draft

**Slide 1 – Hook (robot vs. dev visual, 5s)**
“Good morning! Lately I keep hearing the same question: ‘Is AI about to end front-end development?’ If that thought has kept you up at night, you’re in good company.”

**Slide 2 – Reframe (question on screen)**
“But we’ve been here before. WYSIWYG editors, Ajax, jQuery, SPAs—every new wave felt like it might replace us, and every time we learned how to ride it.”

**Slide 3 – Thesis (timeline teaser)**
“My take is simple: AI isn’t a break, it’s the next step. It boosts what we already do best—creative problem solving, adapting fast, and building great experiences—not just typing code.”

**Slide 4 – Stakes (stat or quote)**
“And there’s urgency. Each era left people behind: the table-layout crowd, the folks who skipped the build step, the ones who never left ES5. This wave is faster, so leaning in now matters.”

**Slide 5 – Roadmap + Disclaimer (eras list)**
“We’ll spend the next 45 minutes walking through six eras—from handwritten HTML to AI-generated UI. This timeline is my own lens, not an official history. Some boxes will be yellow: those are tools I know from the outside but haven’t mastered yet.”

**Slide 6 – Credibility & Invitation**
“I’m Artem Deikun, and I want this to be interactive. After each era slide, feel free to cheer, disagree, or call out a tech that’s missing or misplaced. I’m more than happy to explain why it’s there, tell the story behind it, or admit when it’s just something I’m still learning. Positive, negative, or just curious—bring the feedback.”
