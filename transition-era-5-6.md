## Era 5 → Era 6 — From Meta-Frameworks to AI-Native Creation

Meta-frameworks and design systems gave teams incredible leverage, yet boilerplate and coordination still consumed time. The leap into Era 6 happens as AI copilots move from autocomplete to co-creation, letting developers orchestrate systems while intelligent agents draft UI, tests, and infrastructure.

### Key Catalysts
- React Server Components + streaming architectures exposing finer-grained primitives
- AI pair programmers (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT plugins) embedded in IDEs
- Prompt-to-UI platforms (v0.dev, Galileo AI) proving natural-language design handoff
- Autonomous QA / DevOps (Playwright + LLMs, AI-native CI/CD) shrinking feedback loops
