📢 Glad to share that this Thursday, November 13th, I'll be speaking at the PhillyJS Club in Philadelphia!

Join me for a 1-hour talk: "JavaScript Through the Ages: From Handwritten HTML to AI-Generated UI." We'll take a journey through the fascinating history of front-end development, exploring how our tools, approaches, and goals have evolved over the decades.

My talk will highlight why the current AI era isn't a radical break, but a powerful and exciting evolution in our craft. We'll discuss how understanding our past helps us confidently embrace the future of web development.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and sharing insights!
