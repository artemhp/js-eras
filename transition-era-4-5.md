## Era 4 → Era 5 — From Components to Full-Stack Experience Platforms

Component thinking solved reusability, but front-end teams still wrestled with build times, styling debt, and split stacks. The shift to Era 5 arrived when meta-frameworks, utility-first design systems, and ubiquitous tooling (VS Code) made it normal for one team to own web, mobile, and edge rendering from a single codebase.

### Key Catalysts
- Next.js (with Remix/SvelteKit) blending SSR, SSG, ISR, and edge
- Tailwind CSS + design tokens powering systemized styling
- VS Code + cloud IDE parity making advanced DX universal
- Mobile parity (Chromium WebView, Safari PWA upgrades) proving shared engines
