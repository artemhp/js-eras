## Era 0 → Era 1 — From Static Pages to Interactive Web

The colonization phase proved the web could share documents, but everything was static. The jump to Era 1 happened when JavaScript arrived inside browsers, letting authors manipulate the DOM in real time and paving the way for Dynamic HTML experiences that didn’t require a full page refresh.

### Key Catalysts
- JavaScript embedded in Netscape Navigator
- DOM APIs + Dynamic HTML (DHTML)
- Early event-driven UI patterns (rollovers, form validation)

### UI/UX Shift
- Hover states and link rollovers add motion
- Inline validation reduces failed submissions
- Basic animations make pages feel alive
