## Era 2 → Era 3 — From Standards to Full Web Applications

Once developers trusted shared practices, they pushed further into “JavaScript everywhere.” Faster engines and opinionated frameworks proved browsers could host full application logic, ushering in the SPA boom and the tooling ecosystems to support it.

### Key Catalysts
- Google Chrome + V8 engine leap in JS performance
- AngularJS bringing MVC patterns to the client
- npm ecosystem growth powering modular code

### UI/UX Shift
- Native-like speed for navigation
- Routes and data cached locally
- Transitions feel fluid and app-like

### DX Highlights
- npm + Grunt — automated build steps
- Closure/Uglify plugins — optimization baked into pipelines
- Yeoman CLI — scaffolding for SPA boilerplate
- GitHub PRs — normalized distributed code review
