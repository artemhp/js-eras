# New Introduction Draft

**Slide 1 – Hook (room photo + PhillyJS logo)**
“Welcome to PhillyJS! Thank you for coming out—seeing this many people tells me the topic is hitting a nerve. AI excites a lot of us, but it also scares many of us. It can ship code, fuel no-code tools so non-tech folks ship features, even replace the late-night coding sessions we love.”

**Slide 2 – Grounding (news headline collage)**
“Yes, that’s happening. The industry is moving fast, headlines are loud, and it’s easy to react instead of analyze. As developers with analytical mindsets, we owe it to ourselves to slow down, look at the data, and make our own conclusions.”

**Slide 3 – History Lens (timeline teaser)**
“My favorite way to do that is a retrospective. I’m a history nerd—U.S., Europe, and of course Ukraine. The world feels chaotic right now: wars, conflicts, shaky economies. The only way I stay grounded is by studying patterns.”

**Slide 4 – Quotes (wall of quotes)**
“Those patterns keep showing up. ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.’ ‘History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.’ ‘What has been will be again.’ ‘History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.’ These lines hit harder when you watch tech cycles.”

**Slide 5 – Thesis & Roadmap (eras list)**
“So tonight we’ll look at six eras of front-end—from handwritten HTML to AI-generated UI—and see how history is rhyming again. This is my lens, not an official record. I’ll mark a few boxes in yellow when it’s a tool I know more by study than by daily use.”

**Slide 6 – Invitation**
“I’m Artem Deikun. After each era slide, jump in—positive, negative, or just curious. If you want to challenge why a technology is on the list or hear the story behind it, I’m more than happy to share. Let’s learn the past together so we can build the next chapter on purpose.”
