## Era 1 → Era 2 — From Hand-Rolled Hacks to Shared Standards

Era 1 sites were interactive but fragile; every team inventing its own patterns meant huge maintenance costs. The shift to Era 2 began when asynchronous data flows and shared libraries made it feasible to build rich apps while still honoring standards and accessibility.

### Key Catalysts
- AJAX enabling background data fetches
- JSON as a lightweight data contract
- jQuery smoothing cross-browser DOM work

### UI/UX Shift
- Inline updates replace full reloads
- Forms remember state across interactions
- Sections of a page refresh independently

### DX Highlights
- Firebug — live DOM/CSS inspection
- jQuery plugins — reusable fixes for browser quirks
