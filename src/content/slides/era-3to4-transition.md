## Era 3 → Era 4 — From Frameworks to Components at Scale

SPA-era tooling unlocked ambitious apps, but complexity exploded. The next transition happened when React’s component model, modern JavaScript compilers, and reproducible infrastructure (Docker) offered a way to scale teams without drowning in bespoke build setups.

### Key Catalysts
- React + Virtual DOM redefining UI architecture
- ES2015/TypeScript + Babel standardizing modern syntax
- Docker and containerized pipelines enabling consistent deployments

### UI/UX Shift
- Component libraries enforce consistent design systems
- Micro-interactions and real-time collaboration feel polished

### DX Highlights
- webpack + Yarn — consistent module build chain
- create-react-app CLI — zero-config component scaffolding
- Docker Compose — reproducible dev/stage environments
