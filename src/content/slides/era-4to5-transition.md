## Era 4 → Era 5 — From Components to Full-Stack Experience Platforms

Component thinking solved reusability, but front-end teams still wrestled with build times, styling debt, and split stacks. The shift to Era 5 arrived when meta-frameworks, utility-first design systems, and ubiquitous tooling (VS Code) made it normal for one team to own web, mobile, and edge rendering from a single codebase.

### Key Catalysts
- Next.js blending SSR, SSG, ISR, and edge
- Tailwind CSS + design tokens powering systemized styling
- VS Code + cloud IDE parity making advanced DX universal
- Mobile parity proving shared engines

### UI/UX Shift
- Shared design tokens align web, mobile, and TV
- First paint is nearly instant, content personalizes quickly

### DX Highlights
- Next.js full-stack routing — narrows front-end/back-end gap
- Nx / Turborepo — shared builds for large monorepos
- CLI generators (Next, Remix, SvelteKit) — instant scaffolds
- GitHub Actions — turnkey previews and CI
