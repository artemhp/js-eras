# Conclusion (with "Creating" theme)

**(Transition to a summary slide that visually represents the evolution, perhaps showing the journey from simple HTML to complex frameworks, and then to an AI-assisted UI creation process.)**

"So, we've seen how front-end development has always been changing. From the early days to the age of frameworks, and now to AI, one thing is clear: things are always evolving.

Today, it's more important than ever to keep learning. The changes happening now with AI are even bigger and faster than the old browser wars. But that's not scary—it's exciting! We get to learn completely new things, not just about code, but about new areas like AI. And what's really cool is that we never know what's coming next.

For all of us as developers, this is great news. AI gives us tools to be more productive and to build things faster, from idea to finished project. This means we can spend more time on what really matters: making great experiences for our users. **We are entering an era not of *coding*, but of *creating*, as we usually were as front-end developers.**

So, let's be open to this new chapter. Keep learning, keep building, and have fun with it.

Thank you, and good luck."
