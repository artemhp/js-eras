## Era 2 → Era 3 — From Standards to Full Web Applications

Once developers trusted shared practices, they pushed further into “JavaScript everywhere.” Faster engines and opinionated frameworks proved browsers could host full application logic, ushering in the SPA boom and the tooling ecosystems to support it.

### Key Catalysts
- Google Chrome + V8 engine leap in JS performance
- AngularJS (with Backbone/Ember) bringing MVC patterns to the client
- npm ecosystem growth (Node, package managers) powering modular code

### UI/UX Shift
- SPAs deliver app-like navigation, cached views, and instant route changes
- Users expect native-feeling performance, offline cues, and rich transitions inside the browser
