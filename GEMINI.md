# GEMINI.md: Project Context

This directory contains the content and speaker notes for a presentation titled "JavaScript Through the Ages: From Handwritten HTML to AI-Generated UI" by Artem Deikun.

## Directory Overview

The project is a non-code repository containing a collection of Markdown files that structure a presentation on the history of front-end web development. The content is organized chronologically into distinct "eras," from the early web of 1995 to a speculative future dominated by AI.

The central theme is to frame the current "AI Age" not as a replacement for developers, but as the latest evolution in a long history of changing tools, approaches, and goals in web development.

## Key Files

*   `presentation-introduction.md`: The introductory script for the talk. It sets the stage by visually comparing an early GeoCities-style website to a modern, complex web application.
*   `presentation-conclusion.md`: The concluding script. It summarizes the historical journey and ends with a call to action for developers to learn and adapt to new AI tools.
*   `era-1.md` to `era-6.md`: These are the core content files, each dedicated to a specific era of web development. They contain bulleted lists of key technologies, browsers, influencers, tools, and cultural shifts that defined each period.

## Usage

The files in this directory are intended to be used as the source material and speaker notes for a 45-minute technical presentation. The content is structured to tell a compelling narrative about the evolution of the web, providing a historical context for the rise of AI in software development. The files can be used for practice, reference during the talk, or as a basis for creating presentation slides.
